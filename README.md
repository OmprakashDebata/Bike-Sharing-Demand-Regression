The Bike Sharing Demand Prediction project addresses a critical urban mobility challenge by leveraging environmental and seasonal factors to predict the demand for rental bikes. With the aim of enhancing accessibility and reducing waiting times for the public, this project provides valuable insights into the hourly requirements for rental bikes. By analyzing variables such as temperature, humidity, and seasonal patterns, the model offers predictions that enable more efficient resource allocation and planning for urban bike sharing systems, ultimately contributing to improved mobility and convenience for city residents.

# PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The primary objective is to deliver a comprehensive analysis and predictive model for bike-sharing demand. The project encompasses various essential components, starting with an individual Collaborative (Collab) notebook that serves as the central hub for all data exploration and analysis. This notebook dives into exploratory data analysis (EDA), hypothesis testing, data preprocessing, and the implementation of machine learning models. The dataset at hand comprises a substantial 8,760 rows and 15 columns, offering a rich source of information.

# PROBLEM STATEMENT

The core objective of this project revolved around crafting a precise machine learning model to forecast bike demand across diverse temporal and geographical dimensions within the city. This predictive prowess holds the key to optimizing bike distribution, alleviating shortages, and elevating the overall user experience. The project's comprehensive scope encompassed a spectrum of tasks, from in-depth data exploration and meticulous preprocessing to sophisticated feature engineering and harnessing the power of regression models. Noteworthy methodologies applied included hypothesis testing, meticulous VIF (Variance Inflation Factor) analysis, and the strategic implementation of diverse regression algorithms. Despite grappling with challenges in data preprocessing and model fine-tuning, the project culminated successfully with the development of an intuitive web application. This application now empowers the Seoul Bike Rental Company with real-time demand predictions, ushering in a new era of data-driven decision-making for enhanced operational efficiency.

# HYPOTHESIS

In the hypothesis testing phase of this project, we embarked on a journey to scrutinize the potential relationships between key variables and the rented bike count. Three pivotal hypotheses were formulated and rigorously evaluated. First, we explored the connection between the month of the year and bike rentals, aiming to uncover seasonal patterns. Second, our focus shifted to the hourly time of day, investigating whether specific hours influenced bike demand. Lastly, we delved into the interplay between temperature and dew point temperature, seeking insights into their joint impact on bike rentals. Through meticulous statistical analysis and hypothesis testing, we deciphered these relationships, ultimately informing the predictive modeling process and enhancing our understanding of the factors influencing bike rental trends.

# MODEL BUILDING

- Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Lasso Regression
- Random Forest Regression
- Gradient Boosting Regression

These models were fine-tuned using techniques such as GridSearchCV.

# MODEL EVALUATION

We evaluated model performance using metrics such as:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R-squared (R2)
- The Root Mean Squared Error(RMSE)

# CONCLUSION

In conclusion, the Seoul Bike Rental Demand Prediction project exemplified the power of data-driven decision-making in optimizing bike rental services. Through a meticulous journey of data exploration and preprocessing, we fortified our dataset and uncovered valuable insights. Ingenious feature engineering and model selection processes paved the way for accurate predictions. Notably, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting stood out as the top-performing models. Leveraging hyperparameter tuning techniques, we further refined these models to enhance their predictive prowess. This project not only delivered a robust machine learning model but also underscored the pivotal role of data science in enhancing urban mobility and resource allocation for the Seoul Bike Rental Company.
